## Research

I am fascinated by the constructive nature of perception. I think that transforming imprecise, discrete and abstract, sensory inputs into a continuous, meaningful perception is a *tour the force*. Following R.L. Gregory, I believe perception is essentially an hypothesis generation realised using knowledge derived from the world's statistical structure, from basic principles of perceptual organization to higher-level expectations about what objects are and how they behave. I think that the sensory cortices play a central role in that hypothesis generation  

### Spatiotemporal context reshaping of representations

My early work demonstrated that sensory representations are profoundly modulated by spatiotemporal context. Even in primary sensory cortex, stimulus representations are not fixed: they depend on recent sensory history and surrounding inputs, effectively merging information across space and time. These findings highlight that perceptual grouping and contextual integration emerge from transformations within early cortical circuits, rather than exclusively downstream.

### Experience-driven reshaping of representations

A central theme of my research is how learning reshapes cortical population codes. Through training, representations in sensory cortex become reorganized in a task-specific manner: tuning properties shift, response distributions distort, and activity becomes aligned with behaviorally relevant stimulus dimensions. This experience-dependent restructuring suggests that sensory cortex adapts its representational landscape to better support discrimination and generalization, embedding task demands directly into population activity.

### Geometry of sensory population codes

Building on these insights, I investigate sensory representations through the lens of high-dimensional geometry. By quantifying manifold structure, separability, dimensionality, and task-aligned axes in population activity, I aim to understand how learning alters the computational capacity of cortical circuits. This geometric framework provides a principled way to link neural population structure to limits on discrimination and generalization.

### From representations to perceptual decisions

Ultimately, my goal is to bridge sensory encoding and perceptual decision-making. I seek to identify where behaviorally predictive population variables are read out and how downstream circuits transform these structured representations into categorical percepts and choices. By tracing this transformation across cortical networks, I aim to understand the neural computations that convert representation into perception.
