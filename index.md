# Julien Corbo

## Neuroscientist | Systems & Computational Neuroscience

I study how population geometry in primary visual cortex supports perceptual decisions.

## Research

My work focuses on:

- Population coding and manifold geometry
- Perceptual learning in mouse V1
- Neural representations and decision-making
- Calcium imaging and electrophysiology

### Current Projects

**Learning reshapes V1 population manifolds**  
Investigating how orientation discrimination training alters representational geometry.

**Geometry of decision variables**  
Tracing behaviorally predictive population variables across cortical circuits.
