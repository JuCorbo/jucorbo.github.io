## Research
I am fascinated by the constructive nature of perception. I think that transforming imprecise, discrete and abstract, sensory inputs into a continuous, meaningful perception is a *tour the force*. Following R.L. Gregory, I believe perception is essentially an hypothesis generation realised using knowledge derived from the world's statistical structure, from basic principles of perceptual organization to higher-level expectations about what objects are and how they behave. I think that the sensory cortices play a central role in that hypothesis generation  

### Spatiotemporal context reshaping of representations
An example of low level rules of perception is input grouping for object formation. In the rat somatosensory cortex, I showed that temporally and spatially related tactile inputs can become cortically merged, forming unified representations rather than remaining independent signals. This cortical merging provides a substrate for tactile grouping, demonstrating that perceptual organization is embedded directly within early sensory circuits.

### Experience-driven reshaping of representations
Where cortical merging reflects basic structural regularities of the world (inputs that co-occur likely belong to the same object), learning introduces higher-order constraints derived from task demands and experience. In mouse V1, I showed that training for orientation discrimination induces a systematic distortion of orientation representation: neurons are selectively suppressed around task-relevant stimuli in the feature encoding space. This reshapes the population activity into category-like domains whose activation predicts behavioral performance on a probabilistic level, and promotes generalization of the stimuli ressembling the task's targets.  

### Geometry of V1 representations
The computations that make up perception can be see as an array of representations and readouts. Building on the results obtained by investigating feature encoding, I question the potential impact that learning-induced changes in V1 have on their readout. To do so, I investigate sensory representations through the lens of high-dimensional geometry. By quantifying object manifold structure, separability and dimensionality in population activity, I aim to understand how learning alters the computational capacity of early cortical circuits. 

### From early representations to perceptual decisions
Ultimately, my goal is to bridge sensory encoding and perceptual decision-making. I seek to identify where behaviorally predictive population variables are read out and how downstream circuits transform these structured representations into categorical percepts and choices. By tracing this transformation across cortical networks, I aim to understand the neural computations that convert representation into perception.
